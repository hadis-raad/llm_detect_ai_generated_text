# LLM - Detect AI Generated Text

## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `llm-detect-ai-generated-text.ipynb`, developed for the Kaggle competition "LLM - Detect AI Generated Text." The competition focuses on building models that can distinguish between human-written text and text generated by large language models (LLMs). This notebook outlines our approach, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation strategies.

## Competition Description
The "LLM - Detect AI Generated Text" competition challenges participants to accurately classify text as either human-generated or AI-generated. This has become an essential task as AI-generated text becomes increasingly prevalent and sophisticated.
